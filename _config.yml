  Hi, I go by Pokey and I'm a system administrator. As well as administrating systems I also have experience making software and web apps. I channel my own passion, and create projects as robust as efficient as I can till I get my own Jarvis. For me, every line of code is a opportunity to learn and improve.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>FastAPI</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>React</mark> and <mark>FastAPI</mark>, it has since then grown into a fullstack app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

          BuyerBot is a private SaaS app I built to monitor websites and act on stock availability. The backend handles authentication, token-based billing, and job orchestration with <mark>Redis</mark>. Workers process jobs with <mark>Golang</mark> and report stats via <mark>WebSockets</mark>. The frontend uses <mark>Next.js</mark> and <mark>Mantine UI</mark> to offer clean control panels for users.

          I’ve set up and maintained systems using <mark>NixOS</mark>, <mark>Talos Linux</mark>, and <mark>openSUSE MicroOS</mark>, with a focus on container-first and immutable setups.

My setups prioritize automation, stability, and minimal human error.

          Life is like programming—constant iteration, constant improvement.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I believe the best way to master something is by diving right into it. Whether it's programming, system admin, or exploring new tech, I approach every challenge as an opportunity to build, break, and learn. 

          In my projects, I prioritize solutions that aren't just functional but efficient. Every line of code deserves a purpose, and I believe simplicity leads to the most powerful outcomes. 

          My work is driven by my inner passion—whether it's for tech, building the future one line of code at a time, or just embracing the mechanic mentality as Tony Stark would put it. I channel this enthusiasm into every project, striving to create tools that aren't just useful, but enjoyable! 

          I'm always looking to learn, improve, and adapt. Whether it's through personal projects or contributing to others, I see every experience as a chance to grow and maybe one day, I might have my own Iron Man suit.

          I believe in the power of collaboration and community to achieve outstanding results. I see working together and sharing knowledge as key to driving innovation and growth. 

          Whether through team projects, open-source contributions, or engaging with the tech community, I'm committed to learning from others and contributing to collective success. Working together allows us to tackle complex problems and build solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.
